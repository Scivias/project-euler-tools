# project-euler-tools

Python 3.x library with mathematics tools useful for solving problems of Project Euler.
The backbone of this library are a tuple containing the first 500 primes numbers and a function to find primes up to a limit of about 
12 million using a prime sieve.
These functions make extensive use of the set datatype in preference to sequence types.
